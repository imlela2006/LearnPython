GUESS AND CHECK
Remember our “declarative” definition of square root for x
If we could guess possible values for square root (call it g),
then can use definition to check if g*g = x
We just need a good way to generate guesses
One way to use this idea of generating guesses in order to find a cube root of x
is to first try 0**2, then 1**2, then 2**2, and so on
 Can stop when reach k such that k**2 > x Only a finite number of cases to try
